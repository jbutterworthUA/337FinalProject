# 337FinalProject
Final project for CSC337.


TODO (at least what I remember):

- Cleaning up styling or just making it whatever you guys want.

- watchlist.html. Including linking it to server.js.

- Adding column to the table in catalog.html for "Add to Watchlist" button.
        Doing this should mark the "flagged" attribute to true and remove its row from the catalog table.

- In watchlist.html: 
        Should just be building the same table as in catalog.html.
        But this time only display the ones where "flagged" is true.
        Last column should be "Remove From Watchlist" button which sets flagged to false for the user's specific json file, which will then allow it to appear in catalog.
