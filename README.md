# 337FinalProject
Final project for CSC337.


TODO (at least what I remember):
- watchlist.html. Including linking it to server.js.
- Adding column to the table in catalog.html to "Add to Watchlist".
        Doing this should mark the "flagged" attribute to true and remove its row from the catalog table.

- Adding hrefs to pages to make sure user can jump btwn watchlist and catalog. Also always having the option to logout, which should send them to /start.html again.
